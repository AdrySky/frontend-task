# Frontend Test
This is a simple single-page application to browse the list of events. 
It'll show events with its day of the month, title, image(as background) and favourite icon.

What it can do?:
1. You can filter the events by its city and month.
2. You can choose your favourite events, it'll light up the bookmark icon(top right). It'll save your choice even if you reload later.
3. Also, you can filter by its favourites.

It's available online and you can access it [here](https://adrysky.github.io/frontend-task/)
